Explanation:
Props Interface (GreetingProps):

This interface defines the shape of the props expected by the Greeting component.
name is a required prop of type string.
State Interface (CounterState):

This interface defines the shape of the state for the Counter component.
count is a state variable of type number.
FC Type Annotation (FC<GreetingProps>):

FC stands for FunctionComponent, which is a type provided by React to define functional components.
It ensures the component receives props matching the GreetingProps interface.
Component Class with Generics (Component<{}, CounterState>):

The Component class is annotated with two generic types. The first is for props (which are empty here, represented by {}), and the second is for state (CounterState).
This ensures the state is strongly typed, allowing the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors.
